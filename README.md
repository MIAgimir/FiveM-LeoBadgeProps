## Law Enforcement Props from [LSPDFR - Alex Ashfold](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/misc/32225-eup-badges/)
**I did not make these props, I just made them usable for a FiveM Server**. All I've done is pull these from OIV into a streamable folder for use in a FiveM Server.

Credit for the creation and maintenance of the props / clothing items goes to the [EUP Team](https://discord.gg/fFJKajRcBW)
