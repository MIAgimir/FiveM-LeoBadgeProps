## Law Enforcement Props from [Alex Ashfold](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/misc/32225-eup-badges/)
To be clear, **I did not make these props, nor do I own them**. The proper credit goes to Alex Ashfold and the EUP team for their fantastic work. 

I was looking for badge props for an inventory script I'm using and thought that this could be useful to other servers. All you need to do is stream the props and call them in whatever script you're using *(i.e. using ox_inventory, it can be called as a prop for a usable item)*
